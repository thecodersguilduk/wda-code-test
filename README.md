# Code Test

Create a modular scalable system for working out the average from the array below. (Please copy it
exactly)

[3,7,'df','3',7,8,'df',23,6,2,67,'g','34',12,34,5]

The answer should be 16.2307692

With a very simple frontend that displays the items in a box with an interactive element to activate
the calculation and display it below, when clicked the number will appear below. The frontend
should just have HTML and some CSS generated from SCSS and the javascript should be vanilla
(no libraries).

Colours that should be included:

- Brand1 – #00585E
- Brand2 - #009494
- Brand3 - #F5F2DC
- Brand4 - #454445
- Brand5 - #FF5729

Detail is important, so it's a small task, but the detail could be enhanced with additional code for
ensuring the stability of parts of the system.

It doesn't need to look particularly good (design) as it's more about the coding standards and
maintainability.
